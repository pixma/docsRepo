		About this circuit...
		<br>
		<br>
		#One source is coming from Wall adapter.<br>
		#Second power source is battery.<br>
		So case here is we want battery as backup!!!<br><br>
		So basically we have used Diode OR logic to switch the power supply when the wall power source is cut off.<br><br>
		when wall power source is ON at that time voltage of battery is lower than that of wall power source(condition self acquire). So D1 will protect / cutoff battery to come into circuit and D2 will not allow the current to run into battery but allow to run towards system via Output line as show in pic. <br>
		<br>
		Now if wall power cutt off then at that point battery voltage will be the only source and immediately battery will power the system and D1 will be a blocker and thus current will flow to output line.<br><br>
		
		So this way we can switch power supply between wall power source and battery.
		<br><br>
		<b>Note*:</b>voltage of wall power will be less than voltage of battery! otherwise battery will the primary source .
